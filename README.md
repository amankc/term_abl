## Brief Overview of the Research and use of Scientific Computing

The datasets and methodologies used to construct the terminus ablation time series are illustrated in Fig. 2.

For the research, I am focusing on the source of these freshwater sources i.e. Glaciers. We lack understanding on the precise timing of the iceberg discharge as it deviates from flux estimates due to the stochastic nature of iceberg calving. The above figure depict the principle that I would be using to get the estimates in terminus ablation using both discharge values and near terminus mass change incorporating terminus changes.
